year_data,"Year of observation, mean year for a period rounded up to the nearest year","=AVERAGE(period_start, period_end)"
years_num,Consecutive years included in datapoint; 1 for an annual rate or >1 for an aggregate rate,=(period_end - period_start) + 1
population_summed,"Denominator of rate. Essentially person years, for an annual rate it is the population of the region in that year, for aggregate incidence rates it is the summed population across all years or the average/midyear population multiplied by the number of years in the period (whatever was available), for period prevalence it is the mid-period population.
Every publication had a different way of determinating its population denominator  depending on healthcare coverage, available census data, rounding, averaging etc. If the paper stated that the population was ""stable"" the same value could be applied to the entire time period, however the definition of stable differed between publications",
